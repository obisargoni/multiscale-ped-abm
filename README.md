# repastInterSim
Simulating pedestrian and vehicle interaction at urban intersections

Started off by using the code for a Social Force Model of pedestrian movement given in answer to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44942828/are-there-any-examples-of-pedestrian-modelling-in-repast-simphony

The code given in the answer implements the social force model detailed here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0009448.pdf

However, model actually uses vision based heuristics for pedestrian movement take from Moussaid (2011) https://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6884
