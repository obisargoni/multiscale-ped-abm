/**
 * Adapted from Nick Malleson's FixedGeography interfacce.
 * 
 * Implemented by all objects which hold their own Geometry objects in conjunction with those
 * held by any projections they exist in. For example, a Road object has its geometry stored 
 * by the 'geography' projection, but this geometry can also be found (for simplicity) by calling
 * road.getGeom().<br>
 * Used by EnvironmentFactory.readShapeFile().<br>
 * Must not be used by objects which will move such as People.
