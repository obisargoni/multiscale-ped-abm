Scripts used for processing model runs and producing figures:

1. paths_heatmap.py

Used to bin pedestrian trajectories into hexbins and create heatmaps of trajectories


2. process_batch_results.py

Used to identify which pedestrian journeys could have made use of a crossing and for those journeys calculate the proportion of pedestrians using crossing
vs crossing at an unmarked location

Now that I am recording the crossing choices of the pedestrian agents there are much simpler ways of calculating this information, especially if all pedestrian agents should be crossing at some point.
